# AI Analysis Performance Optimizations

## Current Performance Improvements ✅

### 1. **Separate Custom Prompt Dialog**
- Moved custom prompt to separate dialog to reduce UI clutter
- Better user experience with dedicated prompt editing space

### 2. **Optimized CSV Export**
- CSV export now uses existing shortlist results instead of re-running analysis
- Includes timestamp in filename for better organization
- Only shows export button in AI shortlisted view

### 3. **Extended Timeout**
- Increased Python script timeout from 2 to 3 minutes for complex analysis
- Better error handling and user feedback

### 4. **Improved User Feedback**
- Shows exact number of resumes being analyzed
- Clear progress indicators and loading states

## Additional Speed Optimizations (Recommended)

### 5. **Python Environment Optimizations**
```bash
# Pre-install and cache models to avoid download time
pip install sentence-transformers
python -c "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer; SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5')"
```

### 6. **Concurrent Processing**
- Consider processing multiple resumes in parallel using Python threading
- Batch API calls to Mistral instead of individual calls

### 7. **Model Caching**
- Keep embedding model loaded in memory between requests
- Use a singleton pattern or service worker for model persistence

### 8. **Pre-processing Optimization**
- Cache extracted resume text to avoid re-parsing PDFs
- Store embeddings in database for frequently analyzed resumes

### 9. **API Optimizations**
- Use streaming responses to show real-time progress
- Implement background job processing with progress updates

## Current Typical Processing Times

| Number of Resumes | Expected Time | 
|-------------------|---------------|
| 1-3 resumes       | 30-45 seconds |
| 4-7 resumes       | 60-90 seconds |
| 8-15 resumes      | 90-150 seconds |

## Technical Details

### Bottlenecks Identified:
1. **Model Loading (20-30s)**: Loading sentence transformer model
2. **PDF Processing (5-10s per resume)**: Text extraction from PDFs
3. **AI Analysis (10-15s per candidate)**: Mistral API calls for detailed analysis
4. **Embedding Generation (2-3s per resume)**: Creating vector embeddings

### Quick Wins:
- ✅ Extended timeout to 3 minutes
- ✅ Better progress feedback
- ✅ Cached results to avoid re-computation
- ✅ Separate UI for better UX

### Future Improvements:
- Background job processing
- Model persistence
- Parallel processing
- Resume caching
